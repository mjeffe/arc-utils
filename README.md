# arc-utils
Tools and utilities created and used at Arkansas Research Center 

This is a collection of simple tools we use regularly at ARC. By our
definition, these are scripts not compiled code, which means Perl or Bash.

You will need the [arc-perllib](https://github.com/mjeffe/arc-perllib) project
cloned and in your PERL5LIB path.
